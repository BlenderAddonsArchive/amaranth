Amaranth Toolset
========

Yet another add-on for Blender 2.8+, basically a bunch of tools that I believe improve usability in production environments.


## How to Install
* Download [the latest .zip](https://github.com/venomgfx/amaranth/archive/master.zip)
* In Blender, go to the Preferences under Edit menu > Preferences
* Switch to the add-ons tab. Click "Install...", look for the .zip file.
* Installed! You should see it on the list, simply enable it.
* Optional: Most Amaranth options will be enabled by default, but you can disable some in the add-on settings.
